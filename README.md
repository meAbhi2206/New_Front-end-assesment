# Project Title
## Voting Application

This project implements a simple voting application that allows users to vote for candidates and retrieve the vote count. It includes a frontend interface built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and a smart contract written in Solidity.

## Description

The project consists of three main components:

1. **HTML**: The HTML file (`index.html`) sets up the structure of the web page. It includes buttons for connecting to MetaMask, casting votes, and retrieving vote counts. The user interface elements are positioned to provide a clear and intuitive user experience.

2. **JavaScript**: The JavaScript code is contained in the `script.js` file. It handles the interaction with the smart contract and user actions. It includes functions for connecting to MetaMask, creating an instance of the smart contract, voting for a candidate, and retrieving the vote count. The connected wallet address and vote count are dynamically updated in the HTML file.

3. **Solidity**: The Solidity code is implemented in the `Voting.sol` file. It defines the `Voting` smart contract, which allows users to vote for candidates and retrieves the vote count for each candidate. The contract maintains mappings to keep track of votes and has functions for voting and getting the vote count.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- MetaMask browser extension

### Installation
1. Clone the repository or download the source code files.
```shell
git clone https://github.com/your-code address
```
2. Open the project directory in a code editor.

3. Open `index.html` in a web browser.

### Usage
1. Connect MetaMask:
   - Click the "Connect MetaMask" button.
   - If you have MetaMask installed, it will prompt you to connect and provide account access.

2. Cast Your Vote:
   - Enter the candidate's name in the "Candidate" input field.
   - Click the "Vote" button to cast your vote.
